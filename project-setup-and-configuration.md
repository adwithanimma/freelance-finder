## Project Setup and Configuration

### Folder Setup

Firstly, folders were created for frontend and backend development in order to write the respective code and manage dependencies efficiently.

*Client Folder:*  
Used to develop the frontend of the application using React.

*Server Folder:*  
Used to develop the backend of the application using Node.js and Express.js.
